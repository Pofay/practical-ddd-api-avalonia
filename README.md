# Practical DDD Follow Along (From Pluralsight's Course: Practical DDD)

My output in following along this [Vladimir Khorikov's pluralsight course.](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/domain-driven-design-in-practice)

## Planned Changes

I'll do the following changes for my output on this course:

- Use ReactJS as the UI layer, effectively making this project a ASP.NET Core Application.
- Use EntityFramework instead of NHibernate to deal with persistence related mechanisms.
- Finally, use Avalonia for the Desktop version of this application.
